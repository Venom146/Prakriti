# Prakriti
A simple Ayurvedic Prakriti analysis web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes sign-up and sign-in pages using localStorage for authentication and a quiz to identify the user’s dominant dosha Vata, Pitta, or Kapha based on traits. Clean design, interactive, and beginner-friendly.
# How to run the project
To run this project, first create a new folder on your computer and name it something like **“prakriti-app.”** Inside this folder, save the three HTML files: `index.html` for the Sign In page, `signup.html` for the Sign Up page, and `prakriti.html` for the Prakriti test page. Make sure all files are in the same directory so the page links work correctly. Once the files are saved, open the folder and right-click on `index.html`, then select **“Open with”** and choose your preferred web browser such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox. The project will open in your browser, starting with the Sign In page. If you’re a new user, click the link to sign up, enter your email and password, and create an account. After signing up, return to the Sign In page and log in using your credentials. You’ll then be redirected to the Prakriti analysis page, where you can answer the questions and view your Ayurvedic dosha results. Since this project uses **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and localStorage**, no additional installations or backend setup are required. It runs completely in the browser. Optionally, you can also open it using a local development server like **VS Code Live Server** or host it online using **GitHub Pages** for easier access.
